## Planning and Development Process

Started the project with the idea of having a resource where a user can view climbs, with map attached.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

Google the heck out of everything.

### Unsolved problems

- To have a better filter for different climbs by areas, climbing grade etc
- To generate a link between the climb's latitude & longtitude with the map's input destination
