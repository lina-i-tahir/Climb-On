### User Stories

User will be able to view the the list of climbs available under climbs section.

A Google Map is found under Map, with current location of the user narrowed down, when clicked on the location icon.

The Map will auto suggest places when keyed in prompts.

User is able to copy and paste the coordinates from the climbs into the map, and it will show the route, distance and duration from origin to destination.

## Planning and Development Process

Started the project with the idea of having a resource where a user can view climbs, with map attached.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

Google the heck out of everything.

### Unsolved problems

- To have a better filter for different climbs by areas, climbing grade etc
- To generate a link between the climb's latitude & longtitude with the map's input destination
